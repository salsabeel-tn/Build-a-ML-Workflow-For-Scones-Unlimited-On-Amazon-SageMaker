### ML Workflow For Scones Unlimited On Amazon SageMaker
## Project Introduction<br>
Image Classifiers are used in the field of computer vision to identify the content of an image and it is used across a broad variety of industries, from advanced technologies like autonomous vehicles and augmented reality, to eCommerce platforms, and even in diagnostic medicine.

In this project, I built an image classification model that can automatically detect which kind of vehicle delivery drivers have, in order to route them to the correct loading bay and orders. Assigning delivery professionals who have a bicycle to nearby orders and giving motorcyclists orders that are farther can help Scones Unlimited optimize their operations. This is a portfolio-ready demo that showcases my ability to build and compose scalable, ML-enabled, AWS applications.


In this project, I used:
1) Sagemaker to build an image classification model that can differentiate bicycles from motorcycles.
2) AWS Lambda functions to build supporting services.
3) AWS Step Functions to compose the model and services into an event-driven application.

## Project Steps Overview <br>
Step 1: Data staging<br>
Step 2: Model training and deployment<br>
Step 3: Lambdas and step function workflow<br>
Step 4: Testing and evaluation<br>
Step 5: Scaling the model in productiom<br>
Step 6: Cleanup cloud resources<br>
